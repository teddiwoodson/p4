						<summary>About Doug the Dino</summary>
							<p>My name is Doug the Dino, but you can just call me Doug. I was born between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, according to researchers, but I feel about 200 million years young. I am an herbivore, which is basically the same thing as a vegetarian. It means I only eat plants. I love to eat fruits and veggies—it’s what has helped me to grow big and strong! Other than fruits and veggies, my guilty pleasure is pizza. Margarita pizza, veggie pizza, and cheese pizza. And even the occasional pineapple pizza! I am #TeamPineappleOnPizza all the way.</p>
							<p>I have lots of hobbies including traveling, cooking, and playing games. I love to travel all over the world. I’ve been to places like Egypt to see the pyramids, Australia to see Sydney Harbor, Paris to see the Eiffel Tower, and more. To see some photos from my travels, head to the Travel section next.</p>
							<p>Like I said before, I also enjoy cooking. I’m really good at making pasta and baking. Although, my favorite thing to make is Dino-themed snacks. Stegosaurus Sandwiches, Dinosaur Eggs, Prehistoric Punch are all staples at my house. If you’re getting hungry, I’ve listed some of my recipes for you in the recipes section. </p>
							<p>I also love, love, love to play games. Once a week, when I’m not traveling of course, I invite my friends over for Dinosaur snacks and games. Do you like games? If so, go ahead and see if you can beat the game I’ve left for you down below.  </p>
